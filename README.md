🚀 Day 1 – C++ Bridge Course

✅ Three Core Areas in Programming
To master any programming language, focus on:
Programming Abstractions
Problem-Solving Approach
Syntax

✅ Compiler vs Interpreter
Compiled languages (C++) → Faster execution, optimized performance
Interpreted languages (Python) → Slower, executed line-by-line
Understanding this difference helps in selecting the rightlanguage for a task.

✅ Boilerplate Code in C++
Basic structure of a C++ program includes:
#include <iostream>
int main() {
    return 0;
}

✅ Comments in C++
Used for documentation and explanation inside code:
Single line → // comment
Multi-line → /* comment block */

✅ Variable Declarations
C++ uses static typing
Python uses dynamic typing
Data type must be declared before use in C++

✅ Input and Output in C++
Input → cin
Output → cout
Formatting → endl

Example:
int x;
cin >> x;
cout << "Value: " << x << endl;

✅ Data Types in C++
Primitive data types you should know:
int
float
double
char
bool
Each has different size and memory allocation
