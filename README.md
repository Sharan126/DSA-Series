🚀 Day 1 – C++ Bridge Course

✅ Three Core Areas in Programming
To master any programming language, focus on:
Programming Abstractions
Problem-Solving Approach
Syntax

✅ Compiler vs Interpreter
Compiled languages (C++) → Faster execution, optimized performance
Interpreted languages (Python) → Slower, executed line-by-line
Understanding this difference helps in selecting the rightlanguage for a task.

✅ Boilerplate Code in C++
Basic structure of a C++ program includes:
#include <iostream>
int main() {
    return 0;
}

✅ Comments in C++
Used for documentation and explanation inside code:
Single line → // comment
Multi-line → /* comment block */

✅ Variable Declarations
C++ uses static typing
Python uses dynamic typing
Data type must be declared before use in C++

✅ Input and Output in C++
Input → cin
Output → cout
Formatting → endl

Example:
int x;
cin >> x;
cout << "Value: " << x << endl;

✅ Data Types in C++
Primitive data types you should know:
int
float
double
char
bool
Each has different size and memory allocation

⭐ Day-1 Summary

You learned basic fundamentals needed to start writing C++ programs:
Differences between compiled & interpreted languages
Structure and syntax of a simple C++ program
Variables, input/output, and data types


🌟 Day 2 – C++ Operators,Type Conversion,Conditional Statements
1️⃣ Arithmetic Operators
Operators used to perform mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus.
Example: + , - , * , / , %

2️⃣ Relational Operators
Operators used to compare two values. The result is either true or false.
Example: == , != , > , < , >= , <=

3️⃣ Logical Operators
Operators used to combine multiple conditions.
Example: && (AND), || (OR), ! (NOT)

4️⃣ Assignment Operator
Used to assign values to variables.
Example: =
Also includes compound assignments like +=, -=, *=, /=

5️⃣ Implicit Type Conversion
Automatic conversion done by the compiler when a smaller data type is assigned to a larger data type.
Example: int → float

6️⃣ Explicit Type Conversion (Type Casting)
Manual conversion of one data type into another using casting.
Example: (float)num

7️⃣ Type Conversion (Primitive → String)
Converting numeric or character data into string format.
Example: to_string(num)

8️⃣ Type Conversion (String → Primitive)
Converting a string value back into integer, float, etc.
Example: stoi(s), stof(s)

9️⃣ if Statement
Executes a block of code only if the given condition is true.

🔟 if-else Statement
Executes one block if a condition is true, otherwise executes another block.

1️⃣1️⃣ Nested if-else
Using an if or else block inside another if statement for multiple decision levels.

1️⃣2️⃣ if-else Ladder
A sequence of multiple conditions checked one after another using several else if statements.

1️⃣3️⃣ switch Statement
A decision-making statement that selects one block of code to execute based on the value of a variable or expression.
